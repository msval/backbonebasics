### Backbone Tutorial - user management app

This project is based on a Backbone tutorial by Thomas Davis http://thomasdav.is/

The Author of the original tutorial uses a backend on Heroku, since I wanted
to explore the integration between the Backbone framework and a backend system
I've created my own Java backend project.

You can find the source code of the backend project [here](https://github.com/msval/restfulusers)
